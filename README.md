# Additional material for our LTE Signal Flow Graph publication
This repository contains two forms of additional material regarding the publication.
In the manner of **open science**, this material shall encourage and help researchers to replicate, reproduce and verify what we have done at the Institute of Communication Networks, Hamburg University of Technology.

## MATLAB  Code
In the `matlab` directory you can find all of the MATLAB code that implements the Signal Flow Graphs shown in the paper.

## OMNeT++ Code
In the `omnet` directory you can find the network configuration for the simulation that verifies the analytic results obtained through MATLAB.
This includes both the network description (`.ned` file), as well as the network configuration files (`.ini` file).
